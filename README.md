# Titanic-Dataset-Project
### Project Overview:
#### What will we be doing in this project:
#### 1. Load the dataset:
##### Load the dataset into a pandas data frame and display the first 10 rows of the data frame to gain familiarity with the data structure.
#### 2. Data Cleaning:
##### - Identify and handle missing values appropriately.
##### - Remove any duplicated records.
##### - Convert all date-related columns into a standard format (if applicable).
##### - Create a new column for the passenger's age group ("Child," "Adult," "Senior") based on the 'Age' column.
#### 3. Data Exploratory Data Analysis:
##### - Provide a summary of the dataset using descriptive statistics.
##### - Visualize the distribution of passengers by gender using a bar plot.
##### - Create a histogram for the age distribution.
##### - Visualize the survival rate by gender and class.
##### - You can add any interesting visualizations
#### 4. Basic Statistical Analysis:
##### - Calculate the mean, median, and mode for the 'Fare' and 'Age' columns.
##### - Perform a t-test to determine if there's a significant difference in survival rate based on gender.
##### - You can add any interesting statistical analysis,
#### 5. Documentation:
##### - Explain the rationale for each data cleaning step.
##### - Interpret and explain the visualizations and statistical findings.
